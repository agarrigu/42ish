#### Like 42, but not really

###### If you are currently attending the 42 pool:

Look to your left, look to your right, look in stackoverflow, and _**understand**_. (imho)

These codes will neither pass norminette nor moulinette, be warned.

###### With that out of the way:

These are my attempts at finishing the [42][1] piscine excercises, because they are really fun, and C is really fun, and why not.

`ft_*` are the functions directly demanded by the Exercises, `tf_*` are functions _very_ similar to those demanded directly by the Exercises. All other functions are helper functions.
